## Method

Using the concept of content binding, I was able to make functions for each button in the MainActivity.kt class. In those functions I have a "setOnClickListener" for each button that both changes the color of the button and changes the text in the on screen text field inducating the button pressed. I then decided to make a reset button that takes sets the text field back to empty and the buttons back to white.
